-  **3 unique spells** - Fireball, Ice Shard, and Lightning
-  **Combo system** - Chain gestures together for devastating combo attacks
-  **Animated boss** - Multiple animation states (idle, hit, cleave, death)
-  **Mana system** - Strategic resource management with mana costs and regeneration
-  **Dynamic events** - Boss becomes weak to certain elements, creating tactical opportunities
-  **Visual feedback** - Real-time gesture detection feedback and damage numbers
-  **Sound effects & music** - Immersive audio for spells and background music
-  **Victory/Defeat screens** - Complete game experience with stats and replay

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Webcam
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd MaaaQuackhack
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Start the backend server**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python server.py
   ```
   The server will start on `http://localhost:5001`

4. **Open the game**
   - Open `frontend/index.html` in your web browser
   - Or use a local server (recommended):
     ```bash
     # Using Python
     python -m http.server 8000
     # Then navigate to http://localhost:8000/frontend/
     ```

5. **Allow camera permissions** when prompted

6. **Start playing!**
   - Make gestures with your hand in front of the camera
   - See your spells cast in real-time

## 🎮 How to Play

### Gestures
- **FIST** (All fingers curled) → Fireball 🔥
- **OPEN_PALM** (All fingers extended) → Ice Shard ❄️
- **POINT** (Only index finger extended) → Lightning ⚡

### Combos
Chain gestures together for powerful combo attacks:
- **OPEN_PALM → FIST** = Explosion Combo (25+ damage)
- **OPEN_PALM → POINT** = Healing Light Combo (Damage + Heal)
- **POINT → FIST** = Lightning Strike Combo (35 damage)

### Strategy
- Manage your mana wisely - each spell costs mana
- Collect mana balls that spawn during battle
- Watch for events - boss becomes weak to certain elements
- Execute combos for massive damage
- Time your attacks carefully - boss has cleave attacks!

## 🎯 Key Features Explained

### Gesture Recognition
Uses MediaPipe Hands to detect 21 hand landmarks in real-time. Gestures are classified based on finger extension states:
- Detects when fingers are extended or curled
- Recognizes FIST, OPEN_PALM, POINT, and other gestures
- Runs at 60 FPS in the browser for low latency

### Combo System
Advanced combo detection that recognizes gesture sequences:
- Tracks gesture transitions
- Rewards players for executing combos with bonus damage
- Visual feedback with combo messages

### Mana Management
Strategic resource system:
- Each spell has a mana cost
- Mana regenerates over time
- Mana balls spawn periodically for collection
- Prevents spam casting

### Boss AI
Dynamic boss encounters:
- Multiple animation states
- Random attack patterns
- Phase-based difficulty
- Weakness events for tactical gameplay
